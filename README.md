# Overview

Dolphin Hunter is a game code by Bryan Ham and Designed by Lewis Johnson which offers a game about a dolphin in the sea who has to avoid plastic objects like straws and bottles and eat small fishes. There are 3 Levels, Level 1 includes a cluster of plastic objects, Level 2 includes bigger sharks and threats and fishnets which kills the player (dolphin) and Level 3 is the Win Screen. To win the game, you have to collect all the fish and avoid dangers before the timer runs out.

# Documentation

In dolphin hunter, i developed the game using code tutorials from youtube to create my game. I used Audio Manager, Camera Follower, Coin script, Coin Manager, Finish Point, Kill PLayer, Main Menu, Puase menu, player movement, scene controller, score script, timer for my game, and with the help of my multimedia partner, we created a game that changes, which teaches kids about the dangers of plastic in the form of a video game, with the utilisation of plastic objects and playing as a dolphin.
